# Overview

This software is meant to demonstrate how python can print text, in this case "Hello World", on the command line.

This software prints "Hello World" on the command line upon execution.

The purpose of this software was for me to demonstrate what I learned while setting up my environment in VS Code, as well as the basics of what we can do within this tool.


Here is a link to a video of me demonstrating the code as well as an overview of everything going on within it.
